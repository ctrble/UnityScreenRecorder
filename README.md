Unity Screen Recorder

##READ ME

##Use
This script makes it so that Unity will automatically record screen captures of your game, either whenever you hit Play in the Editor or when you hit the record key. It's perfect for debugging or capturing gameplay to then show off!

##Setup
This .cs script is designed to be added as a component to an empty GameObject in your Scene. 

##Options
Settings can be changed in the Inspector to suit your needs. You can change the frames per second, or set the screenshot size to much larger (great for high resolution screenshots). You can toggle whether Unity will capture screenshots immediately when you hit Play in the Editor, or if it waits for input before starting to record. You can also change which key starts or stops the recording.

##Sharing is caring!
If you fork this and make it even cooler, I'd love to see what you've done! Send me an email at ctrble [at] gmail . com and let me know what you made!
